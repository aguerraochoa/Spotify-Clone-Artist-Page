Spotify Beatles Artist Page

This project is a recreation of the Beatles artist page on Spotify. Even though some javascript is used in some parts, this project was mainly created to practice my CSS skills. Therefore, the majority of the components are non-functional and for visual purposes only.

Features
- Design intended for 13-14 inch screens
- Visually appealing layout that is inspired by the original Spotify artist page
- List of the top 5 Beatles songs
- A functional filter for selecting to see playlists and/or albums in the left part of the screen

Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following installed:

- A text editor or IDE (Ex. Visual Studio Code)

Once you have all of the required dependencies installed, you can clone the repository and open the project in your web browser.
